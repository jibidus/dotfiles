# Dotfiles

[Dotfiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-file) allow you to customize your computer through aliases, configuration, parameters ...
Here are my personal dotfiles dedicated to macOS for development purpose,
maintained through [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io).

# Why a repository for that?

With a git repository, I can backup, tag, track modifications ...
More over, this repository is public which can perhaps help someone when trying to do something similar.

# How to install on a new machine?

```bash
brew install chezmoi
chezmoi init --apply jibidus
```
